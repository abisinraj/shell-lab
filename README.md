# Shell Lab Project

This repository contains a collection of shell scripts demonstrating various Linux/Unix shell programming concepts.

## List of Programs

| Script Name | Description | Key Concepts |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| `program1.sh` | **Circle Properties** | Area & circumference calculation, `bc` |
| `program2.sh` | **Calculator Menu** | `case` statement, `while` loop, arithmetic |
| `program3.sh` | **Largest of Three** | Conditional `if-else`, numerical comparison |
| `program4.sh` | **Mean & Standard Deviation** | Statistical calculations, `bc` with `scale`, `sqrt` logic |
| `program5.sh` | **Reverse Number** | While loop, modulo `%`, integer division `/` |
| `program6.sh` | **Fibonacci Series** | Iterative number generation, variable swapping |
| `program7.sh` | **Armstrong Number** | Cubing digits, accumulation logic |
| `program8.sh` | **Factorial Calculator** | Iterative multiplication, bug-free implementation |
| `program9.sh` | **Prime Numbers** | Nested loops, divisibility check using modulo |
| `program10.sh`| **Palindrome Check** | String reversal using `rev`, string comparison |
| `program11.sh`| **Gross Salary** | Percentage calculations, floating-point arithmetic |
| `program12.sh`| **Time Greeting** | `date` command usage, time-based conditionals |
| `program13.sh`| **File Statistics** | `wc` command, input redirection, file operations |
| `program14.sh`| **Vowel/Consonant Counter** | String manipulation with `sed`, regex, length strings |
| `program15.sh`| **Even/Odd Check** | Modulo arithmetic, simple conditional check |

## Usage
To run any script, make sure it has execution permissions and run it with `./script_name.sh` or `bash script_name.sh`.

Example:
```bash
chmod +x program1.sh
./program1.sh
```

## Comparisons 
Previously, there were two versions of these scripts (`Current-ig` and `Previous-ig`). The `Previous-ig` versions were identified as superior due to:
- Correct logic (fixed bugs like the Factorial calculation)
- Modern syntax (e.g., `$((...))` instead of `expr`)
- Better formatting and robustness
- Comprehensive comments added to explain code logic

All scripts in the root directory are now the improved, commented versions.
